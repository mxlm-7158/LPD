# What you can do to protect the oceans

- Fish Responsibly. While an enjoyable pastime and a craft valued by many, fishing can cause irreversible damage to marine ecosystems if practiced incorrectly.
- Recycle. You've heard this plenty of times, and maybe recycling seems like a given. But it’s vital to remember that disposing of your rubbish correctly can curtail one of the biggest killers of coral. It is estimated that 5.25 trillion pieces of rubbish are in the ocean, only taking into account what’s on the surface.
- Check your Sunscreen. Many sunscreens contain chemicals that are highly toxic to corals.
- Choose sustainable seafood.
- Conserve water. The less water you use, the less runoff and wastewater that eventually find their ways back into the ocean.
- Minimize use of fertilizers. The overuse of fertilizers on lawns harm water quality because nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from the fertilizer are washed into waterways and eventually end up in oceans.
- Be conscious when buying aquarium fish.  Avoid purchasing living coral and if you buy a marine aquarium fish, make sure that it has been collected in a sustainable manner.
- Spread the word!  Learn more about coral reefs and educate your community. Share what you learnt on this site and educate others.
