# Facts about Coral

- Scientists estimate that over 500 million people eat fish caught from coral reefs.
- An individual coral is called a polyp.
- There is evidence of coral reefs being in existence for more than 240 million years! And if you visit a coral reef today, it may be up to 10,000 years old.
- Coral needs sunlight to grow. It is rare to see coral reefs deeper than 75 yards.
- Coral is an animal.
- Coral is related to both jellyfish and anemones.
- Over half of cancer drug research today relies on coral reefs. These marine species are highly intricate and scientists believe there is a wealth of medical knowledge hiding in these reefs.
- Charles Darwin theorized that all species choose to live near their food. However, coral thrives in areas with currents, which makes the water devoid of nutrients. This confused him and is known as Darwin's Paradox.

# Types of coral

1. Fringing reefs grow near the shore. They are quite thin but are often miles long.  
2. Barrier reefs are heavily populated near where the sea floor drops sharply.  
3. Platform reefs are wider at their tops and are often found further away from the coast.  
4. Atolls are circular reefs with a lagoon in the center, and are often found near island in the Pacific ocean.

# Why coral is important
Coral reefs cover less than 1% of the ocean, yet they provide habitat for over 4,000 different species of fish. They play a crucial role in the ecosystem by providing shelter and food for many marine organisms. They form the foundation of coral reefs, which support about 25% of all marine life. They also protect coastlines from storms and erosion, which can be devastating in some areas. Furthermore, coral reefs are nature’s water filtration system. Reefs cannot exist in murky or polluted waters. Many individual corals and sponges consume particles found in the ocean. In turn, this enhances the clarity and quality of the ocean’s waters. Coral reefs control how much carbon dioxide is in the ocean water, as their limestone shell is formed by the ocean’s processing of carbon dioxide. In addition to all of these environmental factors, coral reefs are vital to the tourism industries, creating and protecting many of the world’s most beautiful beaches. More than 500 million people worldwide depend on reefs for foodand jobs.


# What is damaging to coral

- Scientists estimate that over 500 million people eat fish caught from coral reefs.
- Climate change poses the biggest threat to coral reefs, affecting their health and survival.
- Pollution that originates on land but finds its way into coastal waters.
- Overfishing can alter food-chain structure and cause further effects, such as reducing the numbers of grazing fish that keep corals clean of algal overgrowth.
- Rising global (and sea) temperatures cause coral to lose microscopic algae that produce the food they need, also losing their colour. This is known as coral bleaching.
- Increases in ocean acidity reduce the availability of dissolved salts and ions needed by corals to form the calcium carbonate structure.

# Our Solution

### The LPD's Coral Lego build

We have created a lego kit that educates whilst playing. We have reused lego within our school to create a learning kit. The aim of our product is to educate others on the health of our coral reef. Alongside our building instructions we have facts about coral reef, to educate people about them and give advice on how to help this ever-growing issue.
